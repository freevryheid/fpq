# fpq
postgreSQL (pq) fortran bindings

Still under development!

Opted to break the functions into various fpq_modules as done per the libpq documentation. Still thinking how best to do this - may restructure. I've marked all libpq functions in the sources including those STILL TO DO. Some of these are obsolete and probably not necessary.

I'm unsure how to handle the documentation. The source include comments for FORD processing but there is always the option to include links to the online documenation. Why repeat and/or update if always available, right?
