# fpq
postgreSQL (libpq) fortran bindings

WIP!

Progress:

Most low level (pq) functions are now included, at least those I think I'll need  - in the process of developing higher level wrappers for these.

Opted to break the functions into various fpq_modules as done per the [libpq documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq.html).
